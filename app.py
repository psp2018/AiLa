    ---

    #### **Category 4: Tech Stack, Vendors & International Transfers**
    *For CTOs and technical leads*
    - My entire platform is built on AWS. Does their compliance mean my company is compliant?
    - What is a Data Processing Addendum (DPA) and do I need one with my SaaS vendors like Stripe or Mailchimp?
    - I use a software tool from a company based in the USA. What do I need to ensure that data transfer is legal?
    - What are the technical security measures (like encryption and pseudonymization) that are recommended under GDPR?
    - Does the new Swiss FADP have the same strict rules on transferring data outside of Switzerland as GDPR?

    ---

    #### **Category 5: Risk, Breaches & Enforcement**
    *For founders and management*
    - What are the very first steps I must take if I discover my company has had a data breach?
    - When is a company legally required to appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO)?

  AILA (AI Legal Assistant) is powered by a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline that ensures answers are precise, grounded in legal text, and fully explainable.

  ### üß© Key Components:
  - **User Query**: The user submits a GDPR/FADP question.
  - **Document Retrieval**: Relevant articles are fetched using a vector-based retriever (FAISS).
  - **LLM + Refine Chain**: An OpenAI model answers using *only* the retrieved documents.
  - **Formatting + Citations**: The output is formatted with bullet points and source previews.
  - **Indexing**: Articles are preprocessed into metadata-rich chunks stored in a combined index.

  ---

  ### üîç What is RAG?

  **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** is a technique that blends:

  - **Search**: to retrieve the most relevant context (e.g., legal articles),
  - **Generation**: to create an answer based solely on that context.

  This design reduces hallucinations and ensures answers stay aligned with official GDPR/FADP content.
